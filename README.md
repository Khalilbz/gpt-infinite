## GPT Infinite

This is a Node.js based automation tool that helps to automate tasks in chat GPT. It follows a mission-based methodology and currently has two types of missions:

1.  Indexed Content Mission: This mission asks for a specific set of requests and returns detailed documentation or a to-do list. It can also be used for translating large content by splitting it into multiple requests or similar things.
    
2.  Multi-section Indexed Content Mission: This mission asks for a specific set of requests, and for each request, it will ask for a custom set of sections. This can be used to go into detail for a large number of stories, books or any other content by asking for a set number of sections per item.
    

For instance, if you want to create a book of 100 stories, each story with 50 sections, this mission can be used to generate it with just one automation request.

To use this tool, you need to install the Chrome extension and open a chat GPT tab.
